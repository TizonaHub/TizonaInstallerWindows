# TizonaHub Windows Installer

## üñ•Ô∏è What is the TizonaHub Windows Installer?

The TizonaHub Windows Installer is an easy-to-use assistant that helps you install and configure [TizonaHub](https://github.com/TizonaHub) on Windows systems.  
It takes care of all prerequisites, so you don't have to worry about dependencies or manual setup steps.

**Main features:**
- Checks if Node.js, MySQL, and Python are installed.
- If any component is missing, the installer will guide you to install it.
- Verifies that your Node.js, MySQL, and Python versions are compatible with TizonaHub. If not, it offers to update them.
- Automatically generates the `.env` configuration file needed for TizonaHub.
- Prepares the MySQL database.

This ensures your TizonaHub installation is always up to date and ready to use, even if you're not an advanced user!
